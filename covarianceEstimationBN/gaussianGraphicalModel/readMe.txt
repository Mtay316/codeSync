- dualGap.m = computes dual gap of SGGM
- logDataLikelihood.m = computes log data likelihood of GGM
- sggmCV.m = sparse inverse covariance estimation using QUIC with lambda data-drivenly selected through cross validation
- wsggmCV.m = sparse inverse covariance estimation using QUIC with different amount of sparse penalization on each edge, set as exp(-weights/sigma) with lambda and sigma learned through cross validation
